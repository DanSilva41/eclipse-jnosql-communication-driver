*Apache Solr*: Solr is an open-source enterprise-search platform, written in Java, from the Apache Lucene project. Its major features include full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, real-time indexing, dynamic clustering, database integration, NoSQL features and rich document (e.g., Word, PDF) handling. Providing distributed search and index replication, Solr is designed for scalability and fault tolerance. Solr is widely used for enterprise search and analytics use cases and has an active development community and regular releases.

=== How To test

Once this a communication layer to Couchbase, we're using integration test, so you need to install Couchbase. The recommended way is using Docker.

1. Install docker: https://www.docker.com/
2. https://hub.docker.com/_/solr/
3. Run docker command
4. `docker run --name solr_instance -d -p 8983:8983 -t solr`
5. `docker exec -it --user=solr solr_instance bin/solr create_core -c database`
6. Execute the test `mvn clean install`

=== Install without testing

If you won't run the tests the database is not required, so just run the maven skipping the tests.

1. Execute the test `mvn clean install -DskipTests`
