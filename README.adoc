== Contribute to a new Driver

As an open-source project, you're free to create any driver, and you're welcome to join and participate in the process.
To add a new driver, we have a few requirements:

Run Java 11 and Java 17
Include the documentation driver in the README file.
Cover the driver with tests and preferences with TestContainer.
