/**
 * Google Cloud Storage is a RESTful online file storage web service for storing and accessing data on Google's
 * infrastructure. The service combines the performance and scalability of Google's cloud with advanced security
 * and sharing capabilities. It is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), comparable to Amazon S3 online storage
 * service.
 * Contrary to Google Drive and according to different service specifications, Google Cloud Storage
 * appears to be more suitable for enterprises.
